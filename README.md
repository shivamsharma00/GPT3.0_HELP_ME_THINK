### CSE 576: Topics/Natural Language processing Project 1

Welcome to the code for collecting data for prompt engineering using GPT3!

This code allows you to generate QA pairs on a variety of topics and tasks, including public service announcements, plays, haikus, stories, tweets, taglines, jokes, songs, and reports. It utilizes the OpenAI API and GPT3 to generate the text, and saves the output to a .txt file for easy access.

To use this code, you will need to input your own API key for the OpenAI API. Simply replace API key in the code with your own key.

You can choose which topic and task you want to generate QA pairs for by changing the values of "domain_index" and "task_index" respectively. The code will generate 3 instances of QA pairs for each task.

The output .txt file will contain the generated QA pairs, separated by a line break.

Prompt is taken from the [HELP ME THINK: A Simple Prompting Strategy for Non-experts to Create Customized Content with Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08232) as it was the requirement for the project.

Thank you for using this code for collecting data for prompt engineering using GPT3!
